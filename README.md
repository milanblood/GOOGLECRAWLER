# GOOGLECRAWLER

'''
This python project is written for google play app crawler. It will scarpy the APPs detail information from the key word search result page.

The current version is based on the INIDA google play website for the keyword='loan'.

You can change the start_url in spider code to check other keyword.  Also you can change the middlewave part to scrapy a long APP list. 

Now I set up 8 times scroll down of the result page to get the whole app research result.
