Sahukar - Instant Loan for College Students,"500,000+","8,169",Business,4.3,com.sipl.udhaar,Sahukar,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sipl.udhaar,"Sahukar is a digital lending platform that gives personal / pocket money loans to students to help them meet their financial needs such as education and living expenses during their college life. 
We understand that during student life, there is often a cash crunch for small ticket expenses such as tuition, fees, gifting on birthdays or other occasions, extra classes, treating friends – there could be many reasons. We step in to help students so that they need not ask their friends or relatives. We are aware that this can often be embarrassing for students.
On Sahukar, the profile of the students is carefully assessed before a credit limit is assigned to them. Such a credit limit is dynamic or revolving in nature and also closely depends on the repayment history of a borrower. 
The credit limit and hence, the loan taken can be anywhere from ₹ 500 to ₹ 5,000. The student can choose to take the loan in either his Paytm Wallet or his bank account. There is absolutely no need to wait for next month’s pocket money.
The udhaar / loan / pocket money can be easily repaid in maximum 90 days!
The interest rate is only 3% per month. This means that the maximum interest rate per annum is 36% only. For example, if you take a loan of 1000 for 3 months, then after deduction of processing fee, the total interest payable is INR 30 x 3 = INR 90 only.
Students are to note here that Sahukar is backed by an RBI registered legal NBFC as its partner. 
We request all borrowers to read sample loan agreements and loan calculations before placing a request for a loan.

Whenever Banks harass genuine deserving students, without following the RBI rules, ELTF will take up with higher authorities for solution. However ELTF will not undertake to get any loans from Banks. This is a voluntary group of youngsters to create awareness about the education loans in India.
Those who want to get any clarification or guidance from us, please send the full details to our email id action2020eltf@gmail.com  or info@eltf.in
While sending the mail to us, please furnish the full details like, name of the bank, branch, when the loan application was submitted, the course details, the amount of loan sought, how many times the applicant met the branch manager, whether he met the regional manager, the response received from the bank officials etc.
Please also ascertain from the bank the email id of the branch and their regional office.  This may also be included in your mail.
We will examine your complaint and give suggestions to you.  If required, we will also directly take up with Reserve Bank of India for their intervention.  
Please note that ELTF does not guarantee any bank loans to the students.  We give only guidance.  The Banks hold the right to sanction or reject the loan applications, as per rules of the Bank.
ELTF is only a team of volunteers and we have nothing to do with the Government or Banks.",1.0,"February 13, 2017",Updated the content,,,,Mon Dec  9 00:33:53 2019

Sometimes you merely started a brand-new work and you need to wait on your very first salary (and in need of a payday loan or cash advance loan), or your washing machine stopped working and you need a new one. These kinds of things occur regularly, and they can be challenging to manage.
Many times our only choice and best choice is to get a loan, however only few of us know the verity of possibilities to get a personal loans, some appropriate for a good credit score money borrower and some are great loans for bad credit borrowers. Sometimes you need a quick loan, and sometimes time isn’t the issue. Sometimes you want to postpone payments using hard money loan, and sometimes you want a steady payment table so personal loans in the bank, credit card loans or even paypal credit loan can be a good fit. Often, if you’re looking for bad credit loans you can’t get a loan from the bank, so P2P lending (peer to peer lending) may be a good idea.
At the same time, everyone should see how to repair and improve their credit score. We will teach you how to do that also with our credit score repair guide.
78% of the U.S. are living paycheck to paycheck. 
56% have lower than $100 left over at the end of the month. 
If you drop under either of the mentioned groups, you'll must know your alternatives some will surprise you and some are loans for bad credit.
In this mini-course, we will reveal to you what are your money loan alternatives, advantages, as well as disadvantages of different money loans, how to choose which is the appropriate personal loan for you? how to get loans that are good for you? How to improve your credit score and a lot more. 
We divide this course to 7 parts:
💰 Bank Personal Loans - A bank loan is possibly considered as one of the most typical kind of money loans for individuals. A loan from a bank would provide medium or long-term financing. The bank sets the a certain period over which the loan is the interest rate and the timing and also quantity of payments.
💰 Credit Card Money Loans - A loan against the credit card functions more like a personal loan. It is a mean of financing that can help you get quick loan if your need is time sensitive, As long as you have a credit card in your name, you can make use of money against it, normally without the need to offer any kind of new documents.
💰 P2P lending – Peer to peer lending, also abbreviated as P2P lending, is the practice of using an online services and platform to match lenders and borrowers, lending and getting money among individuals or businesses. This way you can skip the middleman and it’s commission. 
💰 Hard Money Loan - A hard money loan is a short-term bridge loan. Many times is used in real estate deals but not only. It allows you to get money loans based largely on the worth of the property being utilized as protection, not on the credit history integrity of the borrower. Since conventional loan providers, like financial institutions and banks, do not offer hard loan funding, hard money loan providers are frequently private individuals or firms.
💰 Payday loans - A payday loan (also called a payday advance, early paycheck loan, money advance,  or cash advance loan) is a small, short-term unsecured money loan, regardless of whether repayment of loans is linked to a borrower’s payday. Payday advance loans rely on the consumer having previous payroll and employment records.
💰 Improve credit score - Credit score is generally determined by considering your record, but there are a handful of factors that you might do in order to improve your credit score. In case you are searching for credit rating repair, you must take into consideration several actions and we will show you what they are as part of this free course

Sometimes you merely started a new job and you have to wait on your first salary and an early paycheck loan (payday loan) is needed, or your fridge broke and you have to purchase a new one and a bank loan or credit card loan or other personal loan is needed. 
Luckily, there are many alternatives to get a personal loan and borrow money, each alternative has different features, pros and cons. Some offer instant loans or fast cash loans, some offer low rate peer to peer lending loans, some take a long look at your credit score (credit rating) and some, like hard money loans, give you fast loan without any credit score history check.
Studies show that 78 percent of people in the USA are living paycheck to paycheck and around 56% have lower than $100 left over at the end of the month. If you fall under either group, you'll need a way to cover unexpected costs if they occur and this loan guide could be a life saver for you.
What to do if you need cash now?
Getting funds whenever you have an unanticipated expense and need cash quickly can be a challenge, especially if you aren't prepared. The answer for most people is to borrow money. However, if you possess bad credit score, don't have a good relationship with a lender, or don't have any assets you may use for collateral, you may not get approved for a conventional personal loan from a national bank. This means that you might need to explore alternative possibilities to get the personal loan you need.
In this borrow money and loan guide, we will show you what are your options, advantages and disadvantages of different loans, how to decide which is the right loan for you? how to get good loans? How to improve your credit score and borrow money easier and cheaper, and more.
$ Bank personal loan - A bank loan is probably the most common way to borrow money for a business or individual. A bank loan offers medium or long-term financing. The bank sets the fixed period over which the loan is supplied, the rate of interest and the timing and amount of payments. 
$ Credit card loans - A credit card loan works like a personal lending. It is a way of financing that can help you meet your financial needs in a fairly short time frame. 
$ Hard Money Loan - A hard money loan is a short-term bridge loan. Many times used in real estate transactions, its terms are based primarily on the worth of the property being used as security, not on the credit reliability of the borrower.
$ Payday loans - A payday loan (also called a payday advance, early salary loan, payroll loan, small dollar loan, short term, or cash advance loan) is a small, short-term unsecured loan, “regardless of whether repayment of loans is linked to a borrower’s payday.” 
$ Peer to peer lending - Peer-to-peer lending, also abbreviated as P2P lending, is the practice of borrowing money and lending money to individuals or businesses through online services that match lenders with borrowers. Since peer-to-peer lending companies operate online, they run with lower overhead and provide cheaper service than traditional financial institutions. 
$ What is Credit Score? Your credit score comes with a substantial effect on your foreseeable future, however you very likely do not know enough about it. A credit rating or a credit score is an assessment of the risk of a borrower. A credit score is mainly based upon a credit report data usually origin from credit bureaus.
$ How to fix and improve credit score? Credit score is generally determined by considering your record, but there are a handful of factors that you might do in order to produce a true influence on your credit score. for credit score repair, you must take into consideration some steps that we reveal in the app.

NO Spam, No Ads - ever!
Everyone with a loan or credit card has a credit score, and staying up to date on yours is crucial. Your credit score affects your major purchases - your car, your house, and even paying for your education. It makes sense to not only track your credit score but also take necessary steps to improve it.
OneScore helps you understand your credit score for free and monitor it regularly. OneScore gives you insights on what makes up your score and alerts you when something changes in your report. Using OneScore does not hurt your score (but not using it may!).
We understand that your credit score is a key piece of personal information. Don’t worry, unlike other apps who spam you with loan offers, we do not use this information for sourcing loans for financial institutions. None of your information is shared with any third parties or institutions.
Inconsistent email ids across accounts? Using too much of your credit card limits? Someone enquiring in the Bureau on your behalf? We will highlight all small and large aspects of your score to help you decide if you wish to act upon or change them to improve your score.
Credit Scores in India are provided by Experian, CIBIL(सिबिल), Equifax and CRIF. OneScore currently shows the Experian credit score.

◼ Credit score is calculated based on the data that is provided by the lending institutions to the bureaus. These include banks like Axis, HDFC, ICICI, IDFC and SBI as well as NBFCs like Bajaj Finance, Magma, Tata Capital, Home Credit, Muthoot and others.
◼ A credit score indicates your creditworthiness to potential lenders such as banks and mortgage lenders. It indicates how responsible you are likely to be in paying off your balances. It depicts your likelihood to repay debt. 
◼ Credit is scored on a scale that ranges from 300 to 900. The higher the number, the better off you are. Get started on your credit journey here!
◼ Keeping a good credit score is beneficial while applying for a job. Employers check credit scores to check how responsible the candidate is before hiring.

This is where a new app called Payday loan comparison may be the ideal solution.  Based on the same ideas as a comparison site, the app takes one set of data from you and provides a wide range of loans in just the flick of a finger.
What the app does:
•	Real time comparison
•	Currently compares 90 lenders from 6 countries: United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.
•	Provides a wide range of loan amounts and periods of time
•	Allows the easy alteration of these terms to see options
•	Shows in real money what the loan will cost
•	Gives a range of helpful advice about loans and other associated areas
•	NO REGISTRATION
•	NO ADS 
Comparison sites are a growth area on the internet with everything from insurance to grocery shopping now having their version.  Loan comparison sites are also very useful for the same reason; a wealth of information in one place having input just one set of details.  This app is created by a company who also run one of these comparison sites so they know what their customers are looking for.  The advice section of the app is also a crucial part of their service, allowing people to fully understand the payday loan, what it costs and what the terms involves area.
Not only that but the app contains ideas about whether a loan is the right option for you, what else might let you sort your problem as well as explain core elements such as APR and payment terms.  It can even let you know what happens if you can pay off the loan on time and what you should expect from your lender if the worst-case scenario comes to pass.
Contrary to popular belief, there are also loans on the app for people with poor credit ratings.  Most companies won’t consider those with problems on their financial records but there are companies who look more at what a customer can afford to pay, rather than what has happened in the past.  These companies feature on the app and mean that even those who have had misadventures in the past can find the right payday loan.  There is also information about how quickly you will receive your money if the timing is the most important factor in your choice, so you can select a loan that gets you the money in the time frame you need it.
The company operating the app is called Cred24.  They are international payday loan experts who operate similar sites around the world and have now brought their knowledge and experience to the US market.  Their aim is that no customer should ever take a loan unless they are confident it is the right choice for them and they fully understand what they are committing to.",1.0.5,"June 16, 2016",,,,,Mon Dec  9 00:35:18 2019

The present living conditions in many countries have made it impossible to avoid unforeseen expenditures. When emergency times come knocking, one is left with no choice than to seek quick financial assistance. Quick payday loans provide a memorably appropriate response at this point in time. Even though problems and trouble come in different forms, the most common one is a monetary problem. This calls for a good short term cash plan and a payday loan has always been the plausible choice because of numerous advantages.
Online Processing
This is one of the major advantages of today's payday loans. They can be granted at the comfort of your living room. This is a clear indication that if you encounter an emergency, you do not have to spend the whole day chasing for signatures. Online application completely eliminates the trouble of moving from one financial institution to another searching for loan approvals.
Easier qualification
The fact that it is easy to qualify for payday loans makes them more appropriate for a cash trapped individual. Borrowers do not have to have an excellent credit history so as to quality for these loans. You only have to be employed or have a stable income and you are qualified for the loan. The primary concern of the lender is that the borrower has dependable means to repay the loan. This is unlike other types of loans where credit score is used to determine one's eligibility to quality for a loan.
Greater flexibility
These payday loans are also flexible. In most cases, there are no restrictions on how the money should be spent. Borrowers have the right to choose what they want to do with the money. This is unlike the other types of loans where one has to use the money on one specified type of spending. 
Abject convenience
It is very easy to deal with quick payday loans. Most of the institutions that offer these loans remain open for longer hours that extend to parts of the night. This is a good convenience for borrowers who have emergencies. Apart from being open, there are also other form of communications for customers such as live chats, phone support and emails. It is not only easy to get the cash advance but also convenient when it comes to loan repayments. 
Speed
These loans are quick to get. If you need the money today, it takes a few hours after waking into a loan store or doing online application. The longer hours one has to wait for approval and signatures are no longer there. 
Quick payday loans are the healer you need when you find yourself stuck with no one to turn to. The good news is that they are processed within a very short time just as the name suggests. They are the most ideal for abrupt money need purposes because they are cleared faster. In addition to this, most of the institutions that offer these loans have completely eliminated the need of endless long queues that characterize the other ordinary loans. The amount of time it takes for the loan to pass or get approved is fast!

Any moment has the potential of becoming a great memory – if you let it. But sometimes, that becomes difficult to do when there are bills to pay and budgets to stick to. So you end up saying no those opportunities and putting that trip or surprise off for another day.
Here at LoanFront, we believe that these memories are too special to be restricted by monetary constraints. That’s why, we make quick, easy loans available to you, as and when you need funds.
So now, you never have to pass up an opportunity to make a moment special. Now, you can always say yes to making memories.
 
Here are a few things that set us apart:
Sometimes, you need larger amounts for emergencies but sometimes you just need a couple of thousand rupees to tide you through the end of the month. That’s why we offer loans starting from as low as ₹2000 right up to ₹2 lakh.
Forget about having to dig out all your important documents.
All we need from you are:
There’s no need to submit your physical documents at our offices. Just use your smartphone to click photos of your documents and upload. 
There’s no need to wait for our personnel to manually check and approve your documents. Our digital processes ensure that verification and approvals happen within minutes.
It can be nerve-wracking to wait for a loan to come through when you need it. At LoanFront, once your processes are complete and the loan is approved, you get the money in your bank account almost immediately.
Once your loan is approved, you need not worry about confusing repayment terms. Our tenures range from 15 days to 12 months, so you can plan your repayment strategy in the easiest and most convenient way.
